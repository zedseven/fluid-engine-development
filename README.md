# Learning Fluid Engine Development
Code based on the book [Fluid Engine Development](https://fluidenginedevelopment.org/), by Doyub Kim.

This is just my repo for code written while reading the book. Not really designed for public consumption,
but I figured there was no reason to make it private.

Done in Rust instead of C++. ðŸ¦€
